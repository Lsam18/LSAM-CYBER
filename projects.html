        <h3>Security Operations - OSSEC HIDS: Detecting the EternalBlue Exploitation</h3>
        <p>This project focused on using OSSEC HIDS (Host-Based Intrusion Detection System) to detect and respond to the well-known EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability exploitation. The attack was simulated in a controlled lab environment, and OSSEC was configured to monitor, log, and generate alerts for suspicious activities related to the exploit. This hands-on exercise highlighted the importance of proactive monitoring in cybersecurity defense and demonstrated how OSSEC can identify critical Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) in real time.</p>
